        <p>Survivor Series, branded as Survivor Series: WarGames since 2022, is a professional wrestling event
            produced annually since 1987 by WWE, the world's largest professional wrestling promotion. Held in
            November generally the week of Thanksgiving, it is the second longest-running pay-per-view (PPV) event
            in history, behind WWE's flagship event, WrestleMania. In addition to traditional PPV since the
            inaugural 1987 event, it has aired via livestreaming since the 2014 event. It is also considered one of
            the company's five biggest events of the year, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, SummerSlam, and
            Money in the Bank, referred to as the "Big Five".

            From 1987 to 2021, the event was characterized by having Survivor Series matches, which were tag team
            elimination matches that typically featured teams of four or five wrestlers against each other.
            Stipulations had also been added to these matches, such as members of the losing team being (kayfabe)
            fired. During these years, only two events did not feature Survivor Series matches: the 1998 event,
            which hosted an elimination tournament for the vacant WWF Championship (now WWE Championship), and the
            2002 event, which saw the debut of the Elimination Chamber, a type of six-person steel cage match won by
            eliminating all other opponents. Since 2022, the event has been based around WarGames matches for the
            men and women. WarGames is a team-based steel cage match where the roofless cage surrounds two rings
            placed side by side and the two teams typically have four to five members each but it is decided by one
            fall instead of eliminating all opponents. As a result, the events since 2022 have also not featured
            Survivor Series matches.

            After WWE reintroduced the brand extension in 2016, the events from 2016 until 2021 centered around
            competition between wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brands for brand supremacy; NXT was also
            involved in 2019. In addition to Survivor Series matches between the brands, the champions of each brand
            faced off in non-title matches. In 2022, the brand supremacy concept was dropped and the event was
            rebranded as "Survivor Series: WarGames", marking WWE's first main roster event to feature the match;
            NXT had its own WarGames event from 2017 to 2021 and it was discontinued after the match was moved to
            Survivor Series in 2022.

            Origins and changes

            The 2005 Survivor Series stage setup at Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, Michigan.
            The first Survivor Series, held in 1987, came on the heels of the success of WrestleMania III, as the
            World Wrestling Federation (WWF) began to see the lucrative potential of the pay-per-view (PPV) market.
            The first event capitalized on the big time feud between André the Giant and Hulk Hogan, who wrestled
            each other at WrestleMania III. Survivor Series was originally created to counter WCW's Starrcade. The
            first eight Survivor Series events took place on either Thanksgiving Day (1987–1990) or Thanksgiving Eve
            (1991–1994). Beginning with the 1995 event, Survivor Series was held on various Sundays before
            Thanksgiving. The 2005 and 2006 events were held on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, while the 2022 and
            2023 events were held on the Saturday after Thanksgiving. The 1997 event was notorious as it featured
            the Montreal Screwjob. Survivor Series was going to be discontinued and rebranded in 2010, but
            following fan outcry, the company decided to continue with the event. Survivor Series became the
            second longest running PPV event in history (behind WrestleMania), and is also regarded as one of the
            "Big Four" pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam, the promotion's
            original four annual events and their four biggest events of the year. From 1993 to 2002, it was
            considered one of the "Big Five", including King of the Ring, but that PPV event was discontinued after
            2002. In August 2021, Money in the Bank became recognized as one of the "Big Five".

            In May 2002, the WWF was renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) following a lawsuit with the
            World Wildlife Fund over the "WWF" initialism. In April 2011, the promotion ceased using its full
            name with the "WWE" abbreviation becoming an orphaned initialism.Also in March 2002, the promotion
            introduced the brand extension, in which the roster was divided between the Raw and SmackDown brands
            where wrestlers were exclusively assigned to perform—ECW became a third brand in 2006. The first
            brand extension was dissolved in August 2011, but it was reintroduced in July 2016. Survivor
            Series, along with the other original "Big Four" events, were the only PPVs to never be held exclusively
            for one brand during either brand split periods. In 2014, Survivor Series began to air on WWE's online
            streaming service, the WWE Network, which launched in February that year, and in 2021, the event
            became available on Peacock as the American version of the WWE Network merged under Peacock in March
            that year.

            As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, WWE had to present the majority of its programming
            for Raw and SmackDown from a behind closed doors set at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida,
            beginning mid-March. In August, these events were relocated to WWE's bio-secure bubble, the WWE
            ThunderDome, hosted at Orlando's Amway Center. The 2020 Survivor Series was in turn produced
            from the ThunderDome and was WWE's final PPV to present the ThunderDome from the Amway Center,
            as in early December, the ThunderDome was relocated to Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida.
            In July 2021, WWE resumed live touring with fans.</p>
