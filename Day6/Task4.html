    <h1>― William Shakespeare, </h1>

  <p>“Love all, trust a few,
Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy
Rather in power than use; and keep thy friend
Under thy own life's key: be check'd for silence,
But never tax'd for speech.”
</p>


<p>“Don't waste your love on somebody, who doesn't value it.”
― William Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet</p>

<p>“Good night, good night! parting is such sweet sorrow,
That I shall say good night till it be morrow.”
― William Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet</p>
