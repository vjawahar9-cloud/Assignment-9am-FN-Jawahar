    <h1>LIONEL MESSI</h1>

    <p style="color: white; margin: 50px;">Lionel Messi (born June 24, 1987, Rosario, Argentina) is an Argentine-born
        football (soccer) player who received
        a record-setting eight Ballon d’Or awards as the world’s top male player (2009–12, 2015, 2019, 2021, and 2023).
        In 2022 he helped Argentina win the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA)’s World Cup.</p>

    <h3> Early life</h3>
    <p class="a2">

        Messi started playing football as a boy and in 1995 joined the youth team of Newell’s Old Boys (a Rosario-based
        top-division football club). Messi’s phenomenal skills garnered the attention of prestigious clubs on both sides
        of the Atlantic. At age 13 Messi and his family relocated to Barcelona, and he began playing for FC Barcelona’s
        under-14 team. He scored 21 goals in 14 games for the junior team, and he quickly graduated through the
        higher-level teams until at age 16 he was given his informal debut with FC Barcelona in a friendly match.</p>

    <h3>International career</h3>
    <p class="a3">
        Despite his dual citizenship and professional success in Spain, Messi’s ties with his homeland remained strong,
        and he was a key member of various Argentine national teams from 2005. He played on Argentina’s victorious 2005
        FIFA World Youth Championship squad, represented the country in the 2006 World Cup, and scored two goals in five
        matches as Argentina swept to the gold medal at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games. Messi helped Argentina reach the
        2010 World Cup quarterfinals, where the team was eliminated by Germany for the second consecutive time in World
        Cup play. At the 2014 World Cup, Messi put on a dazzling display, scoring four goals and almost single-handedly
        propelling an offense-deficient Argentina team through the group stage and into the knockout rounds, where
        Argentina then advanced to the World Cup final for the first time in 24 years. Argentina lost that contest 1–0
        to Germany, but Messi nevertheless won the Golden Ball award as the tournament’s best player. During the 2016
        Copa América Centenario tournament, he netted his 55th international goal to break Gabriel Batistuta’s Argentine
        scoring record.</p>
