        <h1>FOOTBALL</h1>
        <p>Football, also known as soccer in some countries, is the world’s most popular sport. It is played between two
            teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The main objective of the game is to
            score goals by getting the ball into the opponent’s net using any part of the body except the hands and
            arms. Only the goalkeeper is allowed to handle the ball within the penalty area.

            The game is known for its excitement, teamwork, and strategy. It promotes physical fitness, coordination,
            and discipline among players. Major international tournaments like the FIFA World Cup, UEFA Champions
            League, and Copa América attract millions of fans around the globe.</p>

    <section class="history">
        <h2>HISTORY</h2>
        <p>Modern football originated in Britain in the 19th century. Since before medieval times, “folk football” games
            had been played in towns and villages according to local customs and with a minimum of rules.
            Industrialization and urbanization, which reduced the amount of leisure time and space available to the
            working class, combined with a history of legal prohibitions against particularly violent and destructive
            forms of folk football to undermine the game’s status from the early 19th century onward. However, football
            was taken up as a winter game between residence houses at public (independent) schools such as Winchester
            College, Charterhouse, and Eton College. Each school had its own rules; some allowed limited handling of the
            ball and others did not. The variance in rules made it difficult for public schoolboys entering university
            to continue playing except with former schoolmates. As early as 1843 an attempt to standardize and codify
            the rules of play was made at the University of Cambridge, whose students joined most public schools in 1848
            in adopting these “Cambridge rules,”</p>

        <h2>STRATEGY AND TACTICS</h2>
        <p>Use of the feet and (to a lesser extent) the legs to control and pass the ball is football’s most basic
            skill. Heading the ball is particularly prominent when receiving long aerial passes. Since the game’s
            origins, players have displayed their individual skills by going on “solo runs” or dribbling the ball past
            outwitted opponents. But football is essentially a team game based on passing between team members. The
            basic playing styles and skills of individual players reflect their respective playing positions.
            Goalkeepers require agility and height to reach and block the ball when opponents shoot at goal. </p>
