    <h1 style="color:darkblue;">WELCOME TO MY CSS PAGE</h1>
    <p style="color:black;">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the look and layout of
        web pages. It allows
        developers to style HTML elements by changing colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. With CSS, you can design
        attractive web pages and make them responsive for different devices. It separates the content (HTML) from the
        presentation (CSS), making websites easier to maintain and update. CSS can be applied in three ways: inline,
        internal, and external. Overall, CSS is essential for creating visually appealing and well-structured websites.
