    <h1 style>BIOGRAPHY OF SURESH RAINA</h1>
    <hr>

    <h2>Early life</h2>

    <p style="color:peachpuff">Raina was born on 27 November 1986 into a Kashmiri Pandit
        family in Muradnagar, Uttar Pradesh. His parents
        originally hailed from Rainawari, a suburb in the city of Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir.[14][15] Raina's father,
        Trilokchand Raina, was a military officer who used to manufacture bombs at an ordnance factory, while his
        mother, Parvesh Raina, was a housewife.[16][17] He completed his schooling at a boarding school and moved to
        Lucknow in 1998 to attend Guru Gobind Singh Sports College. Raina completed his bachelor's degree in Commerce
        and also holds an honorary doctorate from Vels University, Chennai.[18]</p>

    <h2>International career</h2>

    <p style="color: peachpuff;">Suresh Raina was a middle order batsman.[43] He made his debut for India in a one-day
        international vs Sri Lanka
        in Dambulla on 30th July 2005.[44]

        Raina had a successful career in ODIs playing 226 matches, scoring 5615 runs, averaging 35.3 with the bat at a
        strike rate of 93.5 [45] , playing several crucial and important innings for India.

        He also had a successful career in T20s playing 78 matches, scoring 1605 runs, averaging 29.1 at a strike rate
        of 134.87.[46]

        Raina was a useful part-time off spin bowler in limited overs cricket, getting 36 wickets in ODIs and 13 wickets
        in T20s.[47][48]

        He was one of the top fielders of his time and renowned for his agility, sharp reflexes and throwing accuracy.
        He was often stationed in the inner ring, saving runs and effecting crucial run-outs. Former South African
        Cricketer Jonty Rhodes ranked Suresh Raina as Number 1 in his 'top fielders' list[49]

        Raina however was less successful in tests than in the limited over formats (ODIs, T20s). He played 18 tests for
        India averaging 26.48.[50]

        Let’s move on to the important matches and moments of Suresh Raina’s career.

        In the group stage match vs South Africa in the 2010 T20 World Cup, Raina became the first Indian batsman to
        score a century in T20s.[51][10]

        In the quarter-final of the 2011 Cricket World Cup vs Australia, Raina came in at 187-5 and along with Yuvraj,
        helped India chase down a target of 260 by scoring a significant 34*(28).

        In the semi-final of 2011 Cricket World Cup vs Pakistan, Raina batted with tailenders to score an unbeaten 36, a
        significant contribution to India's final tally of 260.[52]

        Apart from a half-century in the first Test of India tour of England 2011 at Lord's, Raina managed just 27 runs
        from seven innings. He struggled against short bowling and in the final Test was out for a 29-ball duck, the
        longest in India's Test history.[53][54]

        In the second ODI of Indian tour of Sri Lanka 2012, he was out for 1 but he came back stronger in the third ODI
        where he played 45 balls 65 to hand India a five-wicket win and he eventually also won the man of the match
        award for his performance.[55] After the Tour of Sri Lanka, when the England team came to India, he was dropped
        and his spot was given to Yuvraj Singh, who made a comeback after suffering from cancer.[56]

        His knock of 100 against England during England tour of India 2012–13 at Cardiff was nominated to be one of the
        best ODI batting performance of the year by ESPNcricinfo.[57]

        Raina was not selected in India's first tour to USA, where they played against West Indies for 2 T20Is.[58]
        However, he made a re-entry to the ODI team for a series against New Zealand.[59] Later he was ruled out due to
        Chikungunya .
