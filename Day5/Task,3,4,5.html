    <h1 id="name">JAWAHAR</h1>
    <p class="about">Hello! My name is Jawahar. I am a passionate individual with a strong love for both cricket and
        fashion — two fields that inspire me in different but equally exciting ways. Cricket has been a big part of my
        life for as long as I can remember. I enjoy spending time on the field, practicing my batting and bowling
        skills, and learning from every game I play. The sport teaches me teamwork, patience, focus, and the importance
        of continuous improvement.</p>


    <p>On the other hand, fashion allows me to express my creativity and individuality. I love exploring new trends,
        experimenting with colors and styles, and understanding how clothing can reflect one’s personality. Fashion, to
        me, is an art form — a way to express confidence and creativity in everyday life.</p>

    <p>Balancing my passion for cricket and fashion helps me grow both physically and creatively. While cricket keeps me
        active, disciplined, and competitive, fashion gives me space to think imaginatively and express myself freely. I
        aspire to continue developing in both areas and hope to inspire others to follow their passions fearlessly, just
        as I do.</p>
