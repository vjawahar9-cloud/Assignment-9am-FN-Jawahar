    <div class="sticky-header"> <b>About  Porsche 911 GT3</b></div>

    <div class="about">
        <p>The Porsche 911 GT3 is a high-performance homologation model of the Porsche 911 sports car. It is a range of
            high-performance models, which began with the 1973 911 Carrera RS. The GT3 has had a successful racing
            career in the one-make national and regional Porsche Carrera Cup and GT3 Cup Challenge series, as well as
            the international Porsche Supercup supporting the FIA F1 World Championship.

            The 996 GT3 R was introduced in 1999 as a replacement for the 993 RSR. Before its introduction, it was
            extensively tested at Weissach and Paul Ricard. Reduction in weight over the GT3 road car was achieved by
            carbon fibre body panels and plexi-glass rear and side windows. The front nose section contained additional
            air inlets for engine and brake cooling. A steel roll cage was welded into the body and the car was fitted
            with an air-jack system, fire extinguisher and racing seat with safety harness.[70][71]

            The suspension was similar to the GT3 road car in principle, but with variable springs, adjustable shocks,
            anti-roll bars and spherical joints. The car could be set up precisely for each track. Large brake discs
            (standard specifications: 350 mm front and 330 mm rear) were fitted but with no ABS brakes because they were
            not permitted in Le Mans GT3 class.

            The bodyshell with the welded-in safety cage is ten percent stiffer than the 996 RSR. Distinctive wheel
            arches widen the body by 50 mm (2 in) on each side. The relocation of the supplementary oil tank, power
            steering components and battery to the front improve weight distribution. The front and rear lids, the front
            mudguards, the rear section, the doors as well as the front and rear panelling and wing are made of carbon
            fibre. Polycarbonate rear and side windows further aid in weight reduction.

            The newly developed aerodynamic package improves aerodynamic efficiency by a total of around seven percent
            over the 996 RSR. In compliance with the FIA and A.C.O. regulations the new GT3 RSR features a flat
            underbody.

            The RSR featured ZF-Sachs shock absorbers which have Through-Rod-System with considerably lower chamber
            pressure and hence generate less friction than conventional dampers. As a result, they offer a significantly
            improved response characteristic. The improved axles featured new anti-roll-bars, an adjustable upper link
            and an optimised lower link.

            The 911 GT3 and GT3 Touring receive several changes for 2025, including redesigned LED headlamps, a
            redesigned front diffuser and spoiler lip, and modified underbody air guides for improved aerodynamics and
            downforce. Mild suspension geometry tweaks and components have trickled down to the GT3s from the RS, and
            both cars, regardless of transmission, get a shorter final drive ratio for quicker starts. A Weissach
            Package is available for the GT3 that features extensive use of CFRP (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic) for
            the roof and aero elements as well as specific suspension components. Leather and Race-Tex upholstery
            touches augment the interior. The GT3 Touring offers the Lightweight (Leichtbau) Package with similar CFRP
            suspension bits, forged magnesium wheels, and a lightweight battery. Finally, rear seats, unavailable in the
            previous year, return to the option list on the GT3 touring.

            At our test track, the GT3 automatic managed a 2.7-second 60-mph time while the six-speed manual test
            vehicle snapped off a 3.3-second run to 60 mph. The GT3 RS automatic hit 60 mph in the same 2.7 seconds and
            went on to clear the quarter mile in 10.9 seconds at 127 mph, matching the non-RS model's ET. We also tested
            a 2023 Porsche 911 GT3 RS as part of a 0-to-150-to-0 speed test where it bulleted to 150 mph and returned to
            a stop in just 24.4 seconds for the round trip.
