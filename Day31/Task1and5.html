<!-- 1. What is an API? 

Answer:


API = Application Programming Interface. Think of it as a waiter in a restaurant:

You (frontend) → tell waiter what you want (order data)

Waiter (API) → takes request to kitchen (backend/server)

Kitchen → prepares response (data)

Waiter → brings back your food (JSON data) 


5. Difference between localStorage and sessionStorage


Answer:

localStorage and sessionStorage are both Web Storage APIs that allow client-side data persistence in the browser, 
but they differ fundamentally in lifespan and scope. localStorage stores data permanently across browser sessions—it persists
 even when the browser or tabs are closed and reopened, 
making it ideal for user preferences, shopping carts, or application themes that should survive until manually cleared.
