<!-- 1. Define React in your own words -->

 React is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces, especially
single-page applications, by creating reusable components and updating the UI
efficiently.

 <!-- 2.List 3 advantages of React -->

 Reusable Components - Write once, use many times

Fast Performance - Uses Virtual DOM

Easy to Maintain - Clear structure with components

<!-- 3.Explain SPA -->

A Single Page Application loads only one HTML page, and content updates dynamically without reloading the page.
Example: Gmail, Facebook, Instagram


<!-- 4.Difference between React and JavaScript -->

React	               JavaScript

UI library       	Programming language
Used to build UI	Used for logic & behavior
Component-based	    No built-in components


<!-- 5.What is Virtual DOM? -->

The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM.
React updates the Virtual DOM first, compares changes, and then updates only the required parts of the real DOM.
